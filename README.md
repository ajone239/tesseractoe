# Tesseractoe

This repo holds an implementation of a 4x4 tic-tac-toe.
The rules are much the same as 3x3 tic-tac-toe with the addition of squares of like glyphs win.

# Why does this exist?

I want to try out abunch of web frameworks -- namely frontends.
This repo will have at least one backend implementation and many frontends.
The point of all this is to get a feel for each one and report pain points and benefits.

The expected backends are:

- [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum)

The expected frontends are:

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)
- [React](https://react.dev)
- [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)
- [Angular](https://angular.dev)

**Note**: Naming creds to [@karnwine729](https://github.com/karnwine729).
